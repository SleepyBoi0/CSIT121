		<p>My mom first made these cookies when I was a kid and I absolutely loved them. They are the perfect amount of chocolate, I don't like things that are too chocolatey. These cookies are also the perfect consistency, I like my cookies soft and still a little gooy on the inside and if you make them right, these do exactly that.</p>
