			<h2>Music</h2>
			<p>I am obsessed with music. It is very rare that you find me without at least one AirPod in. I don't have a specific genre of music that I exclusively listen to, I listen to a bit of everything, from heavy metal to country. My playlists are very diverse. Music is just so interesting to me, I love the stories that get told through the lyrics and I like the rythme of the beats. Music also helps me focus, I have ADHD so it's hard for me to sit still and work on things for long periods of time unless I find them extremely interesting, but music certainly helps to extend my attention span at least a bit.</p>
