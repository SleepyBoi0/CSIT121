			<h2>Video Games</h2>
			<p>I absolutely love playing video games. As my dad is also a gamer, I have grown up surrounded by video games and consoles. My preffered console is the PlayStation, because its simply better, but overall I am PC gamer. Some of my favorite games are the Assassin's Creed games, the Uncharted games, and Horizon Zero Dawn/Horizon Forbidden West</p>
