			<h2>Hello all!</h2>
			<p>This is my "My Three Things" website. Throughout this website I will be sharing with you some of my favorite things, while also practicing all of the HTML/CSS coding I have learned in my CSIT 121 class.</p>
			<p> I use the text editor <strong>Sublime Text</strong> to do my coding, it is a great software and very user-friendly, I highly suggest it! Throughout this website I use basic HTML for the text and images and an external CSS file for all of the designs such as the backgrounds, colors, etc.</p>
